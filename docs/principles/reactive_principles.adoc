== Reactive Principles

[NOTE]
====
Paradigms and patterns from _Reactive Programming_ and _Reactive Systems_ allow architects and developers to design and implement highly concurrent and distributed software that is performant, scalable, and resilient. _Reactive Systems_ are more flexible and loosely-coupled. They are significantly more tolerant of failure. _Reactive Systems_ are highly responsive, giving users effective interactive feedback.

Quick and often application requirements changes become the precursor for a new paradigm in software design. Few of the most visible triggers: 

* response time measured in milliseconds
* multi-core processors for distributed computations
* uptime close to 100%
* data streaming
* cloud-native applications
* edge-native applications 
* etc.

New systems are built with *Reactive Principles* in their souls.

While engineers start to adopt a new paradigm, they digest it and absorb it. New mental models build upon it. The term *Reactive* gain its' popularity.

Engineers used to perceive the world around them in terms of CPU time and resources utilization. What makes them highly sensitive to not optimal processes. 
There is no need for sociological researches to see how a new practice influence behavior of a group. You can observe it right next-door-project-team. 

That is a time to listen to engineers and calibrate our managerial perception.
