== Responsiveness
ifdef::env-vscode[:relfilesuffix: .adoc]

The manager should respond on time. + 
Always.

The manager is always a proxy in the data flow. Either asked for some information or given the information to be delivered. 

It doesn't matter if a manager has all the resources needed to run the processes right if a manager cannot react/respond within the time constraints. 
It is not only about the fast response time, but also about managing changes. 

_Reactive manager_ effectively detect and deal with problems. Focus on providing rapid and consistent response times. In the worst-case, a manager do not know the right answer or provide not full answer, but still deliver a value.
