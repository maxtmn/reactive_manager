The manager stays responsive under varying workloads.

_Reactive manager_ can react to changes in the tasks input rate by increasing or decreasing resources available for the process. 
This implies designs of processes that have no contention points or central bottlenecks, resulting in the ability to share the tasks with peers and distribute inputs among them. 
Processes built by the reactive manager are predictive and easy to live performance check.

TIP: You are never too busy if you are running an efficient operation.
